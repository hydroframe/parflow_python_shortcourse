    "# Little Washita Parking Lot Test Example\n",
    "This workbook illustrates how to setup and parking lot simulation when you are building and testing your domain. In a \"Parking lot\" simualtion we set the permeability of the subsurface very low and rain on the domain to check that our topographic slopes are setup the way we want and our drainage networks are where we expect them to be. This is a good initial step to do when building a watershed model before you add all the complexity of the subsurface and the land surface model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide comments here on the steps that are unique to a parking lot simulation. For a more thoroughly documented script refer to the [Little Washita Annoated ParFlow-CLM simulation script](https://github.com/hydroframe/parflow_python_shortcourse/blob/main/exercises/little_washita/LittleWashita_ParFlowCLM_AnnotatedExample%20copy.ipynb). \n",

    "Before you can run this workbook you will need to make sure that you have parflow and pftools installed. Refer to the main readme of this repo for instructions on getting your modeling environment setup. if you haven't do so already.\n",
