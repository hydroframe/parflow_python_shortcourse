# Water Balance Example
This example runs a modified Tilted-V simulation using ParFlow with a Python script, then uses Jupyter Notebooks to calculate the water balance.

## Case 1: Simple Rainfall BC
* run `water_balance_x.py`
* run `Water_Balance_Analysis.ipynb`
note: this analysis should provide the same results as the `water_balance_x.tcl` script which uses TCL pftools 

## Case 2: Rainfall BC read from flux file
* run `water_balance_evaptrans.py`
* run `Water_Balance_Analysis_evaptrans.ipynb`
